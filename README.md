Handpoint Android SDK
==============

Overview
---------

Android SDK that can be used to allow the use of the Online payment gateway within an Android application.

Requirements
------------

To build the project, you require Android Studio 2.1.
The project requires a minimum operating system of 4.0.4 to function.

There is only one dependency that may be required to be included for this SDK and that is the "payment" dependency but this may be already included. If this is the case, you may need to just synchronize the Gradle Build first.
